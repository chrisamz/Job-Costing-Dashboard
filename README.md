## Overview

Managing project costs effectively is crucial for any business. The **Job Costing Dashboard** streamlines this process by offering detailed insights into three primary cost categories:

- **Materials:** Direct costs for physical inputs.
- **Labor:** Costs associated with workforce hours.
- **Overhead:** Indirect expenses such as utilities or administrative costs.

By consolidating data into an interactive, user-friendly dashboard, this project allows stakeholders to monitor costs, compare budgets, and optimize profitability.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Data Visualization:** Interactive charts and graphs powered by Dash and Plotly.
- **Cost Breakdown:** Analyze expenses by category (materials, labor, overhead).
- **Profitability Analysis:** Calculate and display gross profit margins.
- **Filtering and Exploration:** Filter data by project, date, or cost category.
- **Drill-Down Insights:** View detailed transaction-level data for any project.

---

## Tech Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- **Python** for scripting and backend logic.
- **Dash** and **Plotly** for building interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **SQL** for data storage and querying.

## Usage

### Input Data

The application expects the following data:

- **Materials Data:** Contains `project_id`, `material_id`, `cost`, and `date`.
- **Labor Data:** Includes `project_id`, `employee_id`, `hours_worked`, `hourly_rate`, and `date`.
- **Overhead Data:** Contains `overhead_id`, `cost_category`, `amount`, and `date`.

### Filters and Exploration
