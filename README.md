## Introduction

In complex projects, understanding the true cost drivers is essential. This Job Costing Dashboard helps visualize and analyze project expenses across three main categories:

- **Materials:** Direct physical inputs and consumables.
- **Labor:** Hours logged and associated costs for team members.
- **Overhead:** Indirect costs such as utilities, rent, and administrative expenses.

By consolidating this information into an interactive dashboard, businesses can quickly identify cost overruns, compare projected vs. actual expenses, and make data-driven decisions to improve profitability.

## Features

- **Dynamic Filtering:** Interactively filter by project, time period, cost category, or team members.
- **Trend Analysis:** View cost trends over time to catch escalating expenses before they impact profitability.
- **Benchmarking:** Compare multiple projects side-by-side to identify best practices and cost-saving measures.
- **Profitability Insights:** Calculate gross profit margins and visualize where the greatest opportunities for cost reduction lie.
- **Drill-Down Exploration:** Click into charts to view underlying data tables for more granular examination.

## Data Pipeline and Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion:** 
   - Source data from a SQL database or CSV files representing materials, labor hours, and overhead expenses.
   - Use Python and Pandas to clean, transform, and aggregate the data.

2. **Data Modeling:**
   - Use SQL queries to join tables related to projects, costs, and time entries.
   - Store aggregated, normalized datasets locally or in a database for quick retrieval.

3. **Dashboard App (Dash):**
   - Build a Dash application to serve the data through interactive Plotly charts and tables.
   - Provide dynamic callbacks to respond to user interactions (date range selection, project filters, cost categories).

4. **Deployment:**
   - Host the dashboard on a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS EC2, or Azure) or within an internal corporate environment.
   - Ensure robust testing and QA to maintain performance and data accuracy.
